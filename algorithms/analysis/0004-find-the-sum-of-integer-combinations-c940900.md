### Problem
Given an array of positive integers and a number `n`, count all combinations with repetition of integers from the array that sum to `n`. The length of the sub-arrays in the combinations must be less than or equal to the length of the initial array.

### Big O Analysis

**Time Complexity:**  
- The algorithm uses three nested loops.
- The outer loop iterates through each number in the input array (`N` times).
- The second loop iterates through the possible lengths of the combinations (`N` times).
- The inner loop iterates through the possible sums up to the target number (`T` times).
- â‡’ **O(N^2 * T)**, where `N` is the number of elements in the input array and `T` is the target number.

**Space Complexity:**  
- The algorithm uses a 2D array (`combinations_arr`) of size `(N + 1) x (T + 1)` to store the intermediate results.
- â‡’ **O(N * T)**

### Laymanâ€™s Terms

- For small inputs, like `find([3, 6, 9, 12], 12)`, the algorithm is very fast.
- For medium inputs, the performance will depend on both the size of the input array and the target number. If either `N` or `T` gets large, the number of operations can grow quickly.
- For large inputs, for example, an array of 50 numbers and a target of 1000, the number of operations would be roughly `50 * 50 * 1000 = 2,500,000`, which is manageable. However, if the target number or the array size becomes very large (e.g., in the tens of thousands), the `N^2 * T` complexity will make the algorithm slow.

ðŸ‘‰ **Rule of thumb:** *The execution time grows quadratically with the size of the input array and linearly with the target number. The memory usage grows linearly with both.*

### Reflection

- **Efficiency:** This dynamic programming solution is effective for moderate constraints. It correctly solves the problem by building up a table of solutions to subproblems.
- **Limits:** The `O(N^2 * T)` time complexity and `O(N * T)` space complexity mean that this solution is not suitable for problems with very large input arrays or target numbers.
- **Improvements:** The space complexity could be optimized to `O(T)` by noticing that in the inner loops, we only ever need the results from the previous length. We could use two arrays of size `T` to store the results for the current and previous lengths, instead of the full 2D array. The time complexity is harder to optimize further for the general case with the given constraints.
- **Lesson Learned:** This problem is a great example of how dynamic programming can be used to solve complex combinatorial problems. It shows the importance of identifying the subproblems and building up a solution from them. It also highlights the need to be mindful of the time and space complexity of DP solutions.
