#### Problem
<Short description of the problem the algorithm solves.>  
Example: “Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.”

---

#### Big O Analysis

**Time Complexity:**  
- <Break down loops/recursions/steps>  
- ⇒ **O(...)**

**Space Complexity:**  
- <Explain memory usage>  
- ⇒ **O(...)**

---

#### Layman’s Terms

- For small inputs: <rough number of operations / what it feels like>.  
- For medium inputs: <show growth with concrete numbers>.  
- For large inputs: <explain why it becomes impractical>.  

👉 **Rule of thumb:** *What happens when input doubles?*

#### Conclusion

- **Efficiency:** Is this good enough for real use?  
- **Limits:** Where does it break down?  
- **Improvements:** How might you make it faster or leaner?  
- **Lesson Learned:** What’s the key takeaway for future algorithms?
