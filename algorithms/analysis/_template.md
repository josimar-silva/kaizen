### Big O Analysis

**Time Complexity:**  
- <Break down loops/recursions/steps>  
- ⇒ **O(...)**

**Space Complexity:**  
- <Explain memory usage>  
- ⇒ **O(...)**

### Layman’s Terms

- For small inputs: <rough number of operations / what it feels like>.  
- For medium inputs: <show growth with concrete numbers>.  
- For large inputs: <explain why it becomes impractical>.  

👉 **Rule of thumb:** *What happens when input doubles?*
