#### Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#### Big O Analysis

**Time Complexity:**  
- The algorithm iterates through the input array `nums` once.
- In each iteration, it performs a constant number of operations: a hash map lookup, a subtraction, and potentially a hash map insertion.
- â‡’ **O(n)**

**Space Complexity:**  
- The algorithm uses a `HashMap` to store the numbers it has seen so far and their indices.
- In the worst-case scenario, the hash map will store all `n` elements of the input array.
- â‡’ **O(n)**

#### Laymanâ€™s Terms

- For small inputs, like an array with 10 numbers, the algorithm is instantaneous.
- For medium inputs, like an array with 1,000 numbers, it's still extremely fast. It just needs to look at each number once.
- For large inputs, like an array with 1,000,000 numbers, the time taken grows linearly. It will take about 1,000,000 operations, which is still very fast for a modern computer.

ðŸ‘‰ **Rule of thumb:** *If you double the number of elements in the array, you double the number of operations. The memory usage also doubles.*

#### Conclusion

- **Efficiency:** The one-pass hash map solution is highly efficient for this problem and is the standard optimal solution.
- **Limits:** The algorithm's performance depends on the efficiency of the hash map implementation. With a good hash map, collisions are rare, and the performance is excellent.
- **Improvements:** For this problem, the O(n) time and O(n) space solution is generally considered optimal. A brute-force O(n^2) solution with O(1) space exists, but it's much slower for large inputs.
- **Lesson Learned:** This problem is a classic introduction to the time-space tradeoff. By using extra space (the hash map), we can significantly reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
